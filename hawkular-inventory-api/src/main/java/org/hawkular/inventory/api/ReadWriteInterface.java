 * relationship between the "source" entity and the newly created one (which is possible through the methods in the
 * write interface). Because the "siblings" in the contains relationship must have mutually different IDs, it is
 * enough in this case to address them by merely string ids (as opposed to full canonical path).

 * @param <Id> the type of the id of the entities, usually a string
 * @param <U> the update type
 * @param <B> the blueprint type
 * @param <Single> the access interface for a single entity
 * @param <Multiple> the access interface for multiple entities
