     * the "source" entities. Each set can have multiple filters that are then applied one after another on their
     * intermediate results. This becomes useful when you want to filter by sources having some kind of relationships
     * with other entities and in addition filter on the sources themselves, too.
     * E.g.:
     * <pre>{@code
     * inventory.tenants().getAll(new Filter[][]{{Related.by("myRel"), With.type(ResourceType.class)},
     * {With.id("asf")}}).entities();
     * }</pre>
     *
     * The filter above would first check that the tenants in question have a relationship called "myRel" with some
     * resource types and then would also check if the tenant has ID "asf".
     *
     * @param filters the sets of filters to apply
     * @return the access to found entities
