/**
 * An ID strategy that by default accepts the proposed ID supplied by the caller.
 *
 * <p>If a feed with the proposed ID already exists in the given tenant and environment, an optional fallback strategy
 * is used to generate a new ID. If the fallback strategy is not defined, an exception is thrown.
 *
 * This strategy is useful for Hawkular deployments where some of the feeds are incapable of remembering their assigned
 * IDs and need to be pre-configured with one.
