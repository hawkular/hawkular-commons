         * <ol>
         *     <li>The embedding of resources into each other - i.e. the child resources are inseparable from their
         *     parent, because they are its parts - e. g. memory subsystem of JVM. These are modelled using 2 separate
         *     relationships in inventory. The containment aspect is modelled by the {@link #contains} relationship and
         *     the hierarchy aspect is modelled by the {@code isParentOf} relationship. When a {@link #contains}
         *     relationship is established between 2 resources, the {@code isParentOf} is automagically added by the
         *     inventory.
         *
         *     <li>Custom hierarchies can be defined between arbitrary resources, regardless of their containment in
         *     other resources. These can be useful to compose ad-hoc "groupings" of resources
         * </ol>
         *
         * <p>This relationship cannot form loops (similarly to {@link #contains}) but allows for 1 resource having more
         * than 1 parent. This is allowed so that custom/parallel resource hierarchies can be created that share the
         * same resources (the most obvious example of this is that a resource that has been discovered and
         * "hierarchized" by a feed can also be put "under" a custom, user-defined, resource).
         *
         *
         * <p>When deleting a resource, all its contained child resources are deleted along with it as mandated by the
         * contract of the {@link #contains} relationship.
