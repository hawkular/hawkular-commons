/**
 * Base class for filters that filter relationships.
 *
 * <p>The implementations of the Hawkular inventory API are supposed to support filtering relationships by
 * {@link RelationWith.PropertyValues},
 * {@link org.hawkular.inventory.api.filters.RelationWith.Ids},
 * {@link org.hawkular.inventory.api.filters.RelationWith.TargetOfType},
 * {@link org.hawkular.inventory.api.filters.RelationWith.SourceOfType} and
 * {@link org.hawkular.inventory.api.filters.RelationWith.SourceOrTargetOfType}.
 *
 * To create these filters, feel free to use the static helper methods defined on {@link RelationWith}.
 * <p>
 * Note: Additional information for the library consumers.<br>
 * Don't extend this class with hope that the new filter will work. This class is extendable only for the benefit of
 * the API implementations that can reuse it internally. For the users of the API, only the subclasses of Filter
 * declared directly in the API are available
 *
