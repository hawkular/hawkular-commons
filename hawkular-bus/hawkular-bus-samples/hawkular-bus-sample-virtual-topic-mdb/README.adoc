A sample MDB inside a war for Hawkular Bus that publishes messages to a topic, which are then consumed by two sample applications (A and B) via queues. This leverages the _virtual topic_ concept within ActiveMQ (http://activemq.apache.org/virtual-destinations.html).

The motivation for using _virtual topics_ is to support multiple instances of a particular consumer, for load balancing and failover support, without consuming (and processing) the message more than one. This is possible using plain queues, except this then only allows a single consuming application. If more than one application is interested in processing the events, and we don't want the producer to have to send that event to multiple queues, then using _virtual topics_ provides the ideal solution. From the producer's perspective they are sending messages to a topic and therefore multiple consumers, while from the consumer perspective they are receiving messages from a load balanced queue, enabling the application to be load balanced across a cluster of servers.

Here's how to set this up:

1. Build hawkular-bus (the messaging framework and wildfly modules)
   (cd <hawkular-bus> ; mvn clean install -Pdev)
2. Build this sample war and deploy it:
   (cd <hawkular-bus>/hawkular-bus-samples/hawkular-bus-sample-virtual-topic-mdb; mvn clean install -Pdev)
3. Run the Wildfly server:
   <hawkular-bus>/hawkular-nest/hawkular-nest-distro/target/wildfly-8.2.0/bin/standalone.sh
4. Point browser to http://localhost:8080/sample-vt-mdb/
5. Enter some text and click submit (this will send a message on "java:/topic/VirtualTopic.ExampleName")
6. See the Wildfly server logs for a message that the MDB prints out showing both AppA and AppB received the message.
