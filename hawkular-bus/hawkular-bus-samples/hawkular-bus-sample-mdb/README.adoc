A sample MDB inside a war for Hawkular Bus that listens to queue 'QueueName'.

This requires the resource adapter installed.

Here's how to set this up:

1. Build hawkular-bus (the messaging framework and wildfly modules)
   (cd <hawkular-bus> ; mvn clean install)
2. Build this sample war and deploy it to hawkular-nest-distro:
   mvn install -Pdev [-Dorg.hawkular.wildfly.home=...where hawkular-nest-distro is...]
3. Run the Wildfly server.
4. Point browser to http://localhost:8080/sample-mdb/
5. Enter some text and click submit (this will send a message on "java:/queue/QueueName")
6. See the Wildfly server logs for a message that the MDB prints out showing it received the message.
