= Hawkular Inventory UI Application

This UI application is built using AngularJS and Patternfly.

== Project Layout

The UI source is located under the folder

```
    hawkular-inventory-ui/src/main/ui
```

It follows the layout proposed in

link:https://github.com/patternfly/angular-patternfly-demo-app[Angular PatternFly Demo App]

Maven automates the installation of tooling `npm`, `bower` and `grunt`, copy UI resources into `target` folder and prepares
the distribution that will be hosted under

```
    hawkular-inventory-ui/target/classes/webroot
```

and packaged into a `hawkular-inventory-ui-*.war`.

All content hosted by the app will be served under the path

```
    http://<host>:<port>/hawkular/inventory/ui
```

== Working on UI

To develop in the UI Application you will need NodeJS tools (optionally Ruby runtime for sass and compass tools).

A standard strategy could be to work locally on your

```
    hawkular-inventory-ui/src/main/ui
```

directory and prepare the dependencies you need to run all the UI elements

```
    cd hawkular-inventory-ui/src/main/ui

    npm install
    sudo npm install -g bower
    bower install
    sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
    sudo npm install -g compass
    gem install sass
    gem install compass
```

These steps will create some folders that will be part of the .gitignore as they can't be pushed into the repository

```
    ui/src/main/ui/node_modules
    ui/src/main/ui/bower_components
    ui/src/main/ui/.sass-cache
    ui/src/main/ui/dist
    ui/src/main/ui/index.html
```

From a terminal you can build the project using `grunt`.

Grunt is an utility to define tasks in the UI project for building and preparing the final distribution.

When working in the UI, an interesting utility is to use

```
    grunt server
```

This will open a server pointing to the AngularJS and will watch for changes into the UI resources and automatically
include them into the working directory.
